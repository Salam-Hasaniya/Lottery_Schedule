# Lottery_Schedule
This project is a Lottery Scheduling Algorithm in C, simulating a process scheduling system where each process is assigned a number of tickets. The scheduler randomly selects a ticket, and the corresponding process gets executed for a fixed time slice. Processes lose tickets over time and are removed once they finish execution.
